Sample Plugin with web interface
================================

On this page you find files for writing a new plugin with a web interface. The plugin consist of a file with Python
code (__init__.py) and a documentation file (README.md). A skeleton of both files is shown below.


A formatted version of the sample README.md can be found here:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:
   :titlesonly:

   /dev/sample_plugin_webif/README.md

A raw version of the README.md for copy and paste can be found below the Python source code.


.. literalinclude:: /dev/sample_plugin_webif/__init__.py
    :caption: __init__.py


The following file outlines the minimum documentation a plugin should have. This README file
should be written in English.
